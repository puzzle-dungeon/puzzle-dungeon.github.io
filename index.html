<h2 id="puzzles">Puzzles</h2>
<h3 id="atomix-puzzle">Atomix Puzzle</h3>
<p>Atomix is a puzzle game where you construct complete molecules,
ranging from simple to highly complex, by arranging isolated atoms
scattered among walls and other obstacles.</p>
<p>When you push an atom in a direction, it moves until it collides with
an object that halts its motion - this could be a wall or another atom.
This mechanic makes Atomix challenging and engaging, as careful planning
is required to organize your molecule correctly.</p>
<p>There are also bonus levels where the colored numbered atoms are used
instead of the chemical atoms. The player must guess the correct number
structure and arrange these atoms into it.</p>
<p>Goal: Build a complete molecule from atoms. Press Enter to select
atoms.</p>
<h3 id="barrel-puzzle-sokoban">Barrel Puzzle (Sokoban)</h3>
<p>This is a classic game with straightforward yet challenging rules.
You guide the “warehouse keeper” (“Sokoban” in Japanese) to push barrels
into designated slots. A barrel can only be pushed in one of four
directions, provided there is empty space behind it in that
direction.</p>
<p>The objective is to place all barrels onto the plates in the room.
Sometimes, barrels must be temporarily moved off plates to enable access
for others. Limited space and the potential for unsolvable positions
make this puzzle both strategic and addictive.</p>
<p>Each level introduces a unique layout of walls, floors, barrels, and
plates, requiring new strategies and solutions.</p>
<p>Goal: Push all barrels onto the designated plates.</p>
<h3 id="color-puzzle">Color Puzzle</h3>
<p>This simple yet intriguing puzzle is designed to demonstrate the
potential of Puzzle mechanics. Some floor cells are assigned colors, and
the number of colors and their areas are configurable. Plates on the
floor can be pressed to alter the colors of the eight surrounding
cells.</p>
<p>Pressing a plate rotates the colors in sequence. For instance, if
there are five colors (1 - red, 2 - green, 3 - blue, 4 - yellow, 5 -
purple) and neighboring cells are colors 1, 3, and 5, pressing the plate
changes them to 2, 4, and 1, respectively.</p>
<p>Goal: Turn all colored cells green by pressing the plates.</p>
<h3 id="fifteen-puzzle">Fifteen Puzzle</h3>
<p>The 15 Puzzle, popularized by Sam Lloyd, is a sliding puzzle. It
consists of 15 numbered tiles, arranged within a 4×4 frame containing
one empty cell. Tiles in the same row or column as the empty cell can be
slid horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>The frame can be of size n×n or even n×m, then the puzzle may be
called the 2ⁿ-1 puzzle or the n×m sliding puzzle rather than 15
Puzzle.</p>
<p>The objective is to rearrange the tiles into numerical order (left to
right, top to bottom). Starting from a shuffled configuration (after
numerous random legal moves), players must use strategic sliding to
return the tiles to their original positions.</p>
<p>No shortest solution is required, the puzzle can be solved using any
valid sequence of moves.</p>
<p>Goal: Restore the numbered tiles to their original positions.</p>
<h3 id="gate-puzzle">Gate Puzzle</h3>
<p>In this puzzle, you navigate a maze filled with plates and gates.
Gates can either be open or closed, blocking or allowing progress.
Plates are scattered throughout the maze and serve as triggers for the
gates.</p>
<p>Each plate toggles the state of one or more attached gates. Pressing
a plate may open previously closed gates while closing others, requiring
careful planning and exploration.</p>
<p>Press Space on keyboard (or “X” on PS controller) to activate the
plate.</p>
<p>Goal: Reach the finish by pressing plates to open a path.</p>
<h3 id="hero-puzzle">Hero Puzzle</h3>
<p>This puzzle challenges the hero to build their power and defeat
enemies.</p>
<p>Similar to Hero Wars bonus levels but with more complexity, the hero
starts with a configured power level. Power can be increased or
decreased using power potions that apply four distinct arithmetic
operations.</p>
<p>To solve the puzzle, the player must strategically navigate the map,
defeating all enemies and collecting items in the correct order.</p>
<p>In the default mode, players collect keys available in each floor
after defeating enemies and gathering potions. Floors can be completed
in any order, but all must be finished. In the “strict_floors” mode,
players must complete a floor before moving to the next and cannot
revisit previous floors.</p>
<p>Goal: Collect all keys (if applicable) and defeat all enemies.</p>
<h3 id="lock-puzzle">Lock Puzzle</h3>
<p>In this puzzle, the maze contains keys and locks of two distinct
types. Closed locks block your progress, and keys are scattered
throughout the maze. Each key can open any lock of the corresponding
type, but once used, a key disappears, and the lock remains permanently
open.</p>
<p>The maze includes branching paths, some of which lead to dead ends.
These branches may still hold valuable keys or locks, requiring
exploration and strategy to navigate effectively. The number and type of
keys are perfectly matched to the number and type of locks, so every key
must be used wisely.</p>
<p>Goal: Reach the finish by collecting and using keys to unlock the
path.</p>
<h3 id="memory-puzzle">Memory Puzzle</h3>
<p>This puzzle tests your memory skills within a grid of cells. The
puzzle area consists of an even number of cells, each containing a
hidden value. All values are randomly shuffled, and pairs of equivalent
numbers are scattered across the grid in a way that their locations are
unknown to the player. Your task is to find and match these pairs.</p>
<p>You select two cells at a time to reveal their values. The first
selected cell stays revealed until the second cell is chosen. If the two
revealed cells match, they are removed from the puzzle. If they do not
match, they are hidden again, and you must remember their positions for
future attempts.</p>
<p>A visual variation replaces numbers with distinct colors for
matching, offering a more aesthetic challenge. The puzzle can be
navigated and manipulated using various controls: arrow keys and Space
for keyboard users, a PlayStation controller for similar precise
navigation, or a mouse for point-and-click simplicity.</p>
<p>Goal: Clear the puzzle area by matching and removing all pairs of
values.</p>
<h3 id="minotaur-puzzle">Minotaur Puzzle</h3>
<p>This puzzle is based on the classic Theseus and the Minotaur game.
The maze consists of floor and wall cells, along with a single finish
cell. Two actors navigate the maze: the player character and the
Minotaur.</p>
<p>The player moves one step per turn in any of the four cardinal
directions (or skips a move by pressing a Space), while the Minotaur
moves up to two steps per turn according to specific rules. The Minotaur
always tries to reach the player by prioritizing horizontal movement
first - if it is not aligned with the player - before making a vertical
move. If a move is blocked by a wall, the Minotaur skips that step.</p>
<p>Each level is designed to be challenging. A direct path to the finish
usually results in the player being caught, forcing the player to find
an alternative, more strategic route to outmaneuver the Minotaur and
reach the finish safely.</p>
<p>Goal: Reach the finish without being caught by the Minotaur.</p>
<h3 id="mirror-puzzle">Mirror Puzzle</h3>
<p>You control how beams of light travel from a beam generator to a beam
collector, using mirrors attached to movable or static objects. These
mirrors reflect the beam in different ways, and may have limited or
flipped activeness. Your objective is to arrange mirrors and possibly
move or reconfigure them so that at least one part of the beam reaches
the collector.</p>
<p>The beam is emitted from the generator in four directions: left,
right, up, and down. Each direction of the beam proceeds cell by cell
until it is reflected, redirected, or terminates. The beam continues
through empty floor cells, void cells, glass, sand, open gates, trap
cells, portals, and also through barrels, enemies, the character, and
mirrors. It is terminated by walls and locks. If it enters a portal, it
instantly appears at the paired portal in the same direction. Portals do
not reflect or bypass; they relocate the beam to the peer.</p>
<p>Mirrors are defined by their orientation, activeness and their
carrier object. There are four mirror orientations:</p>
<p>• Diagonal 1 (/): reflects left ↔︎ down and right ↔︎ up</p>
<p>• Diagonal 2 (): reflects left ↔︎ up and right ↔︎ down</p>
<p>• Horizontal (-): reverses vertical direction (up ↔︎ down)</p>
<p>• Vertical (|): reverses horizontal direction (left ↔︎ right)</p>
<p>Mirrors are active or inactive. An inactive mirror does not affect
the beam at all - it continues straight. An active mirror reflects the
beam according to the list above. Mirrors can also have flipped
activeness: such mirrors are active the first time they are hit by a
beam, but become inactive for that beam on subsequent hits (or vice
versa).</p>
<p>Each mirror is attached to one of three types of carriers:</p>
<p>• Barrels: pushable by the character, move one cell per push on
floor.</p>
<p>• Carts: move on floor, one cell per player instruction, in 0, 1, 2,
or 4 directions depending on movement type.</p>
<p>• Lifts: move across void, stopping at the first obstacle, by player
instruction, with the same direction types as carts.</p>
<p>Goal: Guide the beam from generator to collector through mirrors.</p>
<h3 id="portal-puzzle">Portal Puzzle</h3>
<p>In this puzzle, there are 9 halls arranged in a 3x3 grid. Each hall
has portals located in its corners as the only means of exit. Depending
on the puzzle variation, a hall may have 2, 3, or 4 portals. Each portal
transports the character to one of the 9 halls, with the destination
being pre-determined randomly at the start of the puzzle and remaining
consistent throughout.</p>
<p>The first hall, located in the top-left corner, serves as the
starting point. The central hall is unique; it contains the finish in
one corner and an additional portal in the opposite corner that leads
back to the starting hall. This return portal is added for fun, allowing
players to revisit the challenge and experiment with different portal
choices.</p>
<p>The other 8 halls are structurally identical, each containing the
same number of portals in corresponding corners. Success requires
strategic navigation and exploration to determine the paths that lead to
the central hall and ultimately to the finish.</p>
<p>Goal: Reach the finish by navigating through the portals.</p>
<h3 id="rotatepic-puzzle">RotatePic Puzzle</h3>
<p>This puzzle involves restoring a large image that has been divided
into square mini-image cells. Each cell is randomly rotated by 0, 90,
180, or 270 degrees at the start. Your task is to rotate all mini-image
cells to return them to their correct orientation and recreate the
original image.</p>
<p>The puzzle can be navigated and manipulated using various controls.
With the keyboard, you can use the arrow keys to navigate to a cell and
Space or PageDown (or PageUp) to rotate it clockwise (or
counter-clockwise). The cells may be similarly navigated and rotated
with PlayStation controller. For mouse users, clicking on a cell rotates
it clockwise or anti-clockwise depending on the mouse button used.</p>
<p>Goal: Rotate all mini-image cells to restore the original image.</p>
<h3 id="stoneage-puzzle">StoneAge Puzzle</h3>
<p>This puzzle is an accurate replication of the classic DOS game Stone
Age, released in 1992. The puzzle area consists of various elements,
including a start cell, a finish cell, floors, walls, sands, paired
portals, keys, locks, void cells, and directional lifts. Each element
adds unique mechanics to the challenge.</p>
<p>The character can freely travel through floor cells. Sand cells are
traversable once and transform into void cells upon exit, requiring
careful planning. Portals and directional lifts allow access to
otherwise unreachable areas, while keys of two distinct types can be
collected and used to unlock corresponding locks. Directional lifts are
the only way to cross void cells.</p>
<p>Strategic use of these mechanics is essential to navigate through the
puzzle and access the finish cell. The combination of diverse elements
makes this puzzle both challenging and nostalgic for fans of the
original game.</p>
<p>Goal: Reach the finish by utilizing the environment and its
mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="switchbox-puzzle">SwitchBox Puzzle</h3>
<p>This puzzle is an extension of the Gate Puzzle and the Barrel Puzzle,
introducing complex interactions between gates, plates, and barrels. The
maze contains colored plates that control the behavior of gates and
barrels. Each plate, when pressed by the player or a barrel, activates
all gates and/or barrels of the same color.</p>
<p>Gates are initially closed and block access to parts of the maze,
including the finish. Plates open corresponding gates when pressed.
Barrels can be pushed onto plates or through opened gates. Gates stay
open as long as the corresponding plate is weighted by either the player
or a barrel. If the player pushes a barrel through a gate while keeping
the plate pressed (by standing on it), the gate remains open during the
movement. Gates only close when no one remains on the plate or on the
gate itself.</p>
<p>Additionally, plates may phase barrels - that is, they can switch all
barrels of the same color into a semi-transparent “phased” state when
activated. While in this state, a phased barrel becomes passable: the
player and non-phased barrels can move through it as if it were empty
space. Despite this, a phased barrel still counts as pressing any plate
it rests on, which adds a new layer of strategic planning to the
puzzle.</p>
<p>These dynamic mechanics require careful sequencing of movements and
consideration of gate, plate, and barrel interactions to navigate toward
the finish.</p>
<p>Goal: Open all gates using barrels and reach the finish.</p>
<h3 id="trivial-puzzle">Trivial Puzzle</h3>
<p>This puzzle serves as a demonstration of Puzzle API. It is
minimalistic and relies mostly on default settings, with the only
significant modification being the inclusion of a finish cell. If
enemies are present, they can be avoided.</p>
<p>Goal: Simply reach the finish.</p>
